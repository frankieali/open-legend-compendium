If the same target is affected by this bane from multiple sources, as long as their attack includes one of those who targeted them, they are not affected by the penalty. Unlike other banes, your damaging attack against one target can trigger this bane in a different target, provided your roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve defense (that is, by striking one foe, you can provoke another).<br/><br/><h2>Power Level</h2><ul><li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 1 on attacks that do not include you.</li><li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 2 on attacks that do not include you.</li><li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 3 on attacks that do not include you.</li><li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 4 on attacks that do not include you.</li><li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 5 on attacks that do not include you.</li><li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 6 on attacks that do not include you.</li></ul><br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>Resisting this bane is a minor action.<br/>When inflicting this bane using Agility or Might, you may determine range using the Non-Physical Attack Range table (see Chapter 7: Combat).",
