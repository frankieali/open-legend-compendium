    "effect": "The dominated bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater.\n**Lesser Domination** - The target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn, at which time the bane immediately ends.\n**Greater Domination** - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to end the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target's mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time. Greater Domination has a duration of Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour).",
    "special": "While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.",
