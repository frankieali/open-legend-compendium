The nullify bane is often used by abjurers, engineers, bards, and similar characters built to neutralize the powers of their enemy.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>You cancel a single boon currently in effect if it is of this bane's power level or lower. The invoking power level further impacts the effect according to the Power Level used.<br/><br/><h2>Power Level</h2><ul>  <li><strong>Power Level 1</strong> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1.

If the targeted boon is affecting an area rather than a creature, you roll against the CR of the boon instead of a Resolve defense. The CR is 10 + 2 x the boon's invoked power level.",
