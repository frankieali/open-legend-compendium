Knockdown is a favorite of hulking brutes, telekinetisists, martial artists, and earth elementalists.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>The target falls prone. Prone targets have disadvantage 1 on all attacks they make. Characters that are prone due to the <em>knockdown</em> bane (or any other reason) get +2 to Guard versus Ranged attacks and -2 Guard versus Melee attacks. Standing up from prone requires a move action and costs a character half (round down) of their speed for the round.",
