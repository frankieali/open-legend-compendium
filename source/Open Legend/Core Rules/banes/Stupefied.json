  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a vampire's eyes, a siren's song, and a nymph's beauty are all known to cast a stupor upon weak-willed mortals. Being stupefied causes the target to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the target's Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.<br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional resist roll to break free from the bane. Also any action that would startle a wild animal (being hit with a rock, slapped on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target's typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.",
