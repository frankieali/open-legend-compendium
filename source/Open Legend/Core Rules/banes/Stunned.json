Stunning an enemy can be caused by attacks such as a pistol whip to the back of the head, a kick in the groin, and a deafening thunderclap.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>During the target's turn, they are limited to either a single major action, a single move action, or a single minor action. Effects that grant additional actions do not circumvent this unless they grant a free action. Note that a target expending its move action to resist this bane will receive the remainder of their usual actions if the resist roll succeeds.<br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>This bane has special rules for boss NPCs (See Chapter 8: Running the Game). A boss is only affected by the stunned bane during its normal initiative turn. It may still take all of its boss actions as usual.",
