Whether a raging barbarian or a hyper-focused intergalactic knight, your attacks become particularly ferocious when you enter your battle trance.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>When you make an attack roll in a battle trance, all of the dice in your dice pool explode on either maximum or the number 1 below maximum (though the total is still the number rolled). This means that d4s explode on a 3 or 4, d6s explode on a 5 or 6, d8s explode on a 7 or 8, and so on.",
