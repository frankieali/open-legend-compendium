Whether you gained this ability through years of practice or possess it through heightened senses, the effect is the same: once you've picked up a trail, you almost never lose track of your quarry.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>Unless blinded or thwarted through extraordinary means, you always know the direction of true north. In addition, once you successfully locate the trail of a target, you automatically succeed at all tracking attempts to continue following that trail for 7 days after the time you first picked it up. Only extraordinary concealment, targets in flight, or similarly exceptional cases can cause you to lose your mark.",
