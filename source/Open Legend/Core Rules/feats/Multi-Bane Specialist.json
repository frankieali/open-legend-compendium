  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>You have mastered a signature attack that allows you to invoke two banes at once. A blast of ice that blinds and slows your enemy, a thunderous shotgun blast that hurls foes back and knocks them to the ground, and a wormtongue song that puts targets to sleep and alters their memory are all examples of a signature attack that could be created with this feat.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining <em>knockdown</em> and <em>slowed</em>, both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.<br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>In order to benefit from the bane focus feat when using a multi-bane attack, you must possess bane focus for both banes.<br/>You may take this feat more than once. If you do, you must choose a different pair of banes for the new instance of the feat.",
