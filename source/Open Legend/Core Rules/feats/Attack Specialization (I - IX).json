You gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any <em>damaging</em> attack made with your chosen attack type. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations.<br/>Examples of attack types you can choose to specialize in include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, and force - though this list is not exhaustive.<br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new weapon or attack type each time. Your total advantage to an attack is equal to your tier for that particular weapon or attack type. For example, a character might have Attack Specialization II (Fire) for fire attacks and Attack Specialization IV (Longsword) for longsword attacks.",
