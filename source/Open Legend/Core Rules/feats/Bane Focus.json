  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>You are specialized in the use of a particular bane that is iconic to your character. Perhaps you are a martial artist known for your stunning strikes, a sniper who knows how to slow a target's escape, or a fire mage who sets enemies ablaze with persistent burning damage.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10), you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of inflicting a single bane. Furthermore, when making a bane attack to inflict your chosen bane, you gain advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.<br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different bane.",
