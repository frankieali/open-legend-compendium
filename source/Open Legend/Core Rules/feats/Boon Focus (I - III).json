Examples of this feat in action include a druid who can shapechange at-will, a combat medic who can tend the wounds of many with expert skill, and a mad scientist who can animate mechanical minions effortlessly.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>Choose a single boon that you can invoke. You gain benefits with that boon according to your tier in this feat.<ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:<br /><strong>If the chosen boon has a duration of “sustain persists”</strong>, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the <em>nullify</em> bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6 or greater invocation of that bane.<br /><strong>If the boon has a different duration</strong>, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.</li></ul><br/><br/><h2>Special</h2>In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new boon each time. Your tier of this feat is independent for each boon.",
