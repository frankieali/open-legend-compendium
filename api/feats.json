Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.<br/>In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30.
