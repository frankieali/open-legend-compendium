However, the genie’s services are often served with a bit of mischief on the side.<h2>Special</h2><strong>Wishes:</strong> The genie will grant the owner of the lamp 3 wishes. The genie will often twist or interpret wishes in such a way that the owner gets what they asked for in a completely unfavorable way. For example, if a person wishes to be king of the realm, the genie may transport him upon the throne 1000 years into the future, where the kingdom is a desolate wasteland. Once the lamp has been claimed, a new owner cannot be had until all three wishes are used. After all three wishes have expired, the lamp transports to a completely random point in the world.",
