  "name": "Multi-Attack Specialist (I - VI)",
  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>Whether you are delivering a flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the art of delivering multiple attacks.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>At the start of your turn, you may declare that you are multi-attacking. You must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. You receive a corresponding number of additional major actions, which can only be used for attacks. <em>All</em> of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of <strong>additional</strong> attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.<br/>You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once.<br/>The number of additional attacks you can make with this feat is limited to 1 + half your level, rounded up. Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level.<br/><strong>Example</strong> - Vax the Deathbringer has Multi-Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10'-cube. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that data-attack-5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.",
