  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>You are adept at redirecting your enemy's attacks. Whether using fancy footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you know how to force your enemy to attack unintended targets.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>When you make a defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker's action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to a target that is neither you, nor the attacker. The original attack roll does not change, only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you can redirect it to anyone within 5' of you (as opposed to within 5' of the attacker).",
