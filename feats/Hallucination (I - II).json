  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>You are able to use your powers of illusion to not only create phantasmal figments, but to completely dominate the sensory perceptions of individual targets. Such power is wielded by the likes of legendary enchanters, psychics, and shamans. Those who can master such powers are often capable of neutralizing angry mobs without shedding a drop of blood.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>You gain benefits according to your tier in this feat.<ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - When you invoke the <em>phantasm</em> bane, you may choose to create a hallucination within a single target's mind instead of an illusion that is perceptible to everyone. You gain complete control over the target's senses (as granted by the power level of your bane), and thus the hallucination is not restricted by size or area. Your hallucination may only target a single creature and is not eligible for multi-targeting attacks. In addition, unless the target is damaged, they suffer disadvantage on resist rolls against the bane.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - When you invoke the hallucination form of the <em>phantasm</em> bane, you may target additional creatures within range as determined by your Influence score. This does not count as a multi-target attack and thus does not incur disadvantage on your action roll.<ul><li><strong>Influence 7</strong> - 5 targets</li><li><strong>Influence 8</strong> - 10 targets</li><li><strong>Influence 9</strong> - 50 targets</li></ul></li></ul>",
