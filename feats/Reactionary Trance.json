  "content": "<h2>Description</h2>Your intense focus never lapses, allowing you to tap into your heightened battle trance at a moment's notice. Examples of this feat in play include a hulking brute who snaps into a rage at the first sign of danger and a trained gunslinger who is always ready for a fight.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>You can enter a battle trance (as per the Battle Trance feat) as a free action even when it is not your turn. You may choose to do so in reaction to another action, such as an enemy's attack, spell, or insult. You may even declare your intent to enter a battle trance after the action has been resolved (such as after the attack has already been rolled). The benefits granted from your battle trance take place before the triggering action is resolved, potentially negating damage or harmful effects that you would have otherwise incurred.",
