Examples of this boon in action include a psychic who can connect with the minds of others and a far future artificial intelligence capable of passing information to other beings through the vibration of quantum strings.<br/><br/><h2>Effect</h2>You and the target can communicate with each other simply through thought. Note that this telepathy does not bestow intelligence upon creatures, so you could not use it to communicate with a squirrel unless you already possessed other means of doing so. Additionally, telepathy does not bypass language barriers, so you would need to already speak the language of your target.<br/><br/><h2>Power Level</h2><ul><li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can communicate telepathically with a single creature of animal-level intelligence or lower.
