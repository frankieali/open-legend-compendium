In order to do so, you must invoke this boon using an action roll (i.e., it is not compatible with the automatic success granted by the <em>boon focus</em> feat). The Challenge Rating to dispel a bane in this manner is equal to 20 + twice the bane's power level. So, for example, a power level 9 bane can be dispelled on a roll of 38 even if the invoker does not have an attribute score of 9.",
